        <h3>Albums</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>'Thriller' (1982)</li>
            <blackout>Thriller is the sixth studio album by the American singer and songwriter Michael Jackson,
            released on November 30, 1982, by Epic Records. It was produced by Quincy Jones, who had previously 
            worked with Jackson on his 1979 album Off the Wall. Jackson wanted to create an album where "every 
            song was a killer". With the ongoing backlash against disco music at the time, he moved in a new 
            musical direction, resulting in a mix of pop, post-disco, rock, funk, and R&B sounds. Thriller 
            foreshadows the contradictory themes of Jackson's personal life, as he began using a motif of 
            paranoia and darker themes. Paul McCartney appears on "The Girl Is Mine", the first credited 
            appearance of a featured artist on a Michael Jackson album. Recording took place from April to 
            November 1982 at Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California, with a budget of $750,000.</blackout>
            <li>'Bad' (1979)</li>
            <blackout>Bad is the seventh studio album by the American singer and songwriter Michael Jackson. 
            It was released on August 31, 1987, by Epic Records, nearly five years after Jackson's previous 
            album, Thriller (1982). Written and recorded between January 1985 and July 1987, Bad was the third 
            and final collaboration between Jackson and producer Quincy Jones, with Jackson co-producing and 
            composing all but two tracks. Jackson notably adopted an edgy look and sound with Bad, departing 
            from his signature groove-based style and high-pitched vocals. The album incorporates pop, rock,
            funk, R&B, dance, soul, and hard rock styles. Jackson also experimented with newer recording 
            technology, including digital synthesizers and drum machines, resulting in a sleeker and more 
            aggressive sound. Jackson wrote nine of the eleven songs on the album. Lyrical themes on the album 
            include media bias, paranoia, racial profiling, romance, self-improvement, and world peace. The 
            album features appearances from Siedah Garrett and Stevie Wonder.</blackout>
            <li>'Dangerous' (1975)</li>
            <blackout>Dangerous is the eighth studio album by the American singer Michael Jackson. It was 
            released by Epic Records on November 26, 1991, more than four years after Jackson's previous album,
            Bad (1987). Co-produced by Jackson, Bill Bottrell, Teddy Riley, and Bruce Swedien, the album was 
            Jackson's first since Forever, Michael (1975) without longtime collaborator Quincy Jones. Featured 
            appearances include Heavy D, Princess Stéphanie of Monaco, Slash and Wreckx-n-Effect. Dangerous is 
            widely described as an R&B album in popular music, with elements of new jack swing, a growing genre 
            at the time. Elements of industrial, funk, hip hop, electronic, gospel, classical and rock are also 
            featured. Twelve of the album's fourteen songs were written or co-written by Jackson, discussing 
            topics like racism, poverty, romance, self-improvement, and the welfare of children and the world.
