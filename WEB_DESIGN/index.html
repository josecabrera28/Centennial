    <h2>
        THE SPARK!
    </h2>
    <p> 
        Everything started when traveling to US to visit my brother and his beautiful family.
        Experiencing a new world with its good and not so good things made my mind change without notice,
        I started being more humble focused in my own goals and not regret as I was used to towards myself.
        I noticed we had the option to go after more in life ..... or not, but it would be my decision.
        When I got back to Colombia I realized my home was not my apartment but me and someone else who
        all this is dedicated to because without her, I would be nothing, but that is another story that 
        I will tell you later. Going back to our topic, I started to judge behaiviors I used to have like
        driving car, toxic relationships as family too. After this life experience I was curious and wanted
        to know what if I would take the risk and try to build another live, a different carreer, different 
        loves.

    <h3>
        THE INVESTIGATION
    </h3>
    <p>
        Everyone says facebook and some large companies spy on us when we talk with friend through our own
        phones, and now I think they do, because I remember one day I just opened faceboook and I saw an 
        advertisement about an international event to study in Canada besides, the ticket was sheap then I 
        decided to go.

    <h4>
        THE AGENCY
    </h4>
    <p>
        When looking for an agency to help with the process of visa, college application, housing, tickets and
        more, a friend of mine from University posted a picture on the snow and I asked her where she was then, 
        she reaplied she was in Toronto Canada and started with a billion questions regarding weather, people,
        and of course money. Later on, I asked her about what agency helped her in the process, thus she contacted
        me with them.
